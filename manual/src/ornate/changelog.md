## Version 0.13.0

> 2018 Jun 5

This release contains an important revamp on the way webpack support works.
Webpack produces a json [stats output](https://webpack.js.org/api/stats) which
describes in detail the results of processing your application. Thus, parsing
stats we can learn exactly what files are produced rather than guessing.

Due to the very nature of parsing the output, and the wide variety of webpack
configurations this process may not work in all cases. Please lets us know if
you find any issues.

**Note:** `Stats` parsing has been tested mostly in Webpack 4. The results may vary with
older versions.

**Note:** If your webpack produces any kind of std output, parsing stats will likely break.

This fixes the following bugs:

- [#192](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalajs-bundler/issues/192): Webpack failed to create application bundle
- [#111](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalajs-bundler/issues/111): Lots of warnings about source map URLs

- [#242](https://github.com/scalacenter/scalajs-bundler/pull/242): Better error display when the webpack call fails
